## This is a Torch plugin template

Use this template to create your repository for a Torch plugin. Remember to change the plugin name in the appropriate places:

* Plugin.cs file
* manifest.xml repository and project settings
* SE-Torch-TorchPlugin.csproj file name (if you so wish), RootNamespace and AssemblyName
* ConfigView.xaml title text



You will also need to provide a replacement GUID for the plugin in manifest.xml to avoid issues with GUID collisions, especially if releasing!
